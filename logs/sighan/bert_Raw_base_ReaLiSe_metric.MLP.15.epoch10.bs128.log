Some weights of the model checkpoint at hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext were not used when initializing BertModelForCSC: ['cls.seq_relationship.bias', 'cls.seq_relationship.weight']
- This IS expected if you are initializing BertModelForCSC from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining model).
- This IS NOT expected if you are initializing BertModelForCSC from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification model).
Some weights of BertModelForCSC were not initialized from the model checkpoint at hfl/chinese-roberta-wwm-ext and are newly initialized: ['mlp.bias', 'bias', 'mlp.weight']
You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to use it for predictions and inference.
